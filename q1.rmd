#Question 1
  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
flights <- read.csv('C:\\Users\\Kathleen\\Downloads\\STA380-master\\STA380-master\\data\\ABIA.csv', header = TRUE)
summary(flights)
library(dplyr)
library(mosaic)
```
The following shows the number of cancelled flights by destination and airline leaving Austin. In otherwords, which locations not to fly to from Austin given the high number of cancellations. 
```{r}
counts <- table(flights$UniqueCarrier, flights$Dest)
barplot(counts, main="Cancelled Flights from Austin by Destination and Airline in 2008",
        xlab="Destination", 
        legend = rownames(counts)) 
```
